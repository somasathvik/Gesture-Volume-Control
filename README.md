# Gesture-Volume-Control

A computer vision based project.

You can control the Volume of your PC using gestures from your fingers, which are monitored by your webcam.

You can pinch in with your thumb and index finger to decrease the Volume and pinch out to increase the Volume. The Frame rate, Live volume and it's percentage with a bar graph are displayed on the screen. You can manually adjust the smoothness of the gestures.
